# Design Challenge 2 - Light-activated light strip

I created a simple script to turn on neopixels on the circuit playground and a connected light strip when the average light level is above a certain value and turn them off when it goes back down. The inspiration for this is that my desktop is actually inside my closet and I use a light strip along the ceiling. This uses an IR remote but I wanted to be able to turn it on automatically when I open the closet door. The light strip I use has 3 inputs, one for each RGB value that I would need to push to the strip instead of how I have it currently coded, but I would also need to solder wires to it which I can't currently do (it uses pins to connect to the current control board)
